###Position Contextualization
{
The room is a 10x10 square. Navigate to the first coordinate listed for each object. Then call the face_coordinate function to face the rest of the coordinates specified to scan the object.
Coordinates of objects:
{
Jeff's desk: {(3,0). (4,0), and (4,1)}
Bobs's desk: {(2,4). (2,5), and (3,5)}

```

Explanation:
- We import the CreateRobot class from the LLMRobot package.
- We create an instance of the CreateRobot class and call the face_coordinate function to make the robot face Jeff's desk.
- The face_coordinate function takes two arguments: the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate of the desired final location. In this case, we want to face the desk at (3,0).Time used (unit: s): 6.2968621253967285

{Write Python Code to: Make the robot face the opposite direction it is currently facing.}

Solution:
{To make the robot face the opposite direction it is currently facing, we can simply call the face_coordinate function with the current position as the new position. We can get the current position by calling the get_position function from the Robot API. Here's the code:

```python
from LLMRobot import CreateRobot

robot = CreateRobot()

# Get the current position of the robot
current_position = robot.get_position()

# Call the face_coordinate function with the current position as the new position
robot.face_coordinate(current_position[0], current_position[1])
```

This code will make the robot face the opposite direction it is currently facing.Time used (unit: s): 7.700591564178467

###Image Processing API: Below are all the functions that perform image processing from a class called "ImageProcessing" in a package called "LLMRobot".
{
get_color_image(): Takes and saves an RGB image of the scene in front of a robot in a file called "cameraImage.jpg".
findObject(string obj): Searches for a specified object class in "cameraImage.jpg". The image must be taken prior to calling this function. Returns true if the object class is detected, false otherwise.
	Argument 1: The name of the object class. This function can search for the following object classes: “water bottle”, “TV”, “bowl”, “book”, "person"
objectCounts(): Returns a dictionary listing all the objects detected in front of the robot as keys and the amount of them as values.
depthToObject(string obj): Returns how far away in meters the object is from the robot.
	Argument 1: The name of the object class. This function can recognize the following object classes: “water bottle”, “TV”, “bowl”, “book”, "person"

###Position Contextualization
{
The room is a 10x10 square. Navigate to the first coordinate listed for each object. Then call the face_coordinate function to face the rest of the coordinates specified to scan the object.
Coordinates of objects:
{
Jeff's desk: {(3,0). (4,0), and (4,1)}
Bobs's desk: {(2,4). (2,5), and (3,5)}
}
}
}

###Instruction:
{Write Python Code to: Make the robot face the opposite direction.}

```python
from LLMRobot import CreateRobot

robot = CreateRobot()

robot.face_coordinate(-3, 0)
```

Explanation:
- We import the CreateRobot class from the LLMRobot package.
- We create an instance of the CreateRobot class and call the face_coordinate function to face the opposite direction.
- The face_coordinate function takes two arguments: the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate of the position to face towards. In this case, we want to face towards (-3, 0), which is the opposite direction of the first coordinate listed for Jeff's desk.Time used (unit: s): 6.83630895614624

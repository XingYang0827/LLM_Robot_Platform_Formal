Using only the functions below, write Python code to make a robot drive 2 meters forward.

Below are all the functions that control a robot from a class called "RobotFunctions" in "LLM_based_robot_revised.py":

drive_distance(float32 distance, float32 max_translation_speed): The robot will drive straight until it has traveled the specified distance in the odometry frame and then stop. It will drive backwards if distance is negative.
Argument 1: The distance (in meters) the robot should travel, positive for forwards and negative for backwards motion
Argument 2: The speed (in meters per second) at which the robot will move (any real number in the range of 1 to 10).

rotate_angle(float32 angle, float32 max_rotation_speed): The robot will rotate until it has achieved the desired angle offset.
Argument 1: The relative angle of rotation (in radians) from the current position. If the angle is negative, the robot will rotate clockwise. If the angle is positive, the robot will rotate counterclockwise.
Argument 2: The speed (in radians per second) at which the robot will rotate (any real number in the range of 1 to 10).

drive_arc(float32 angle, float32 radius, int8 translate_direction, float32 max_translation_speed): The robot will drive along an arc defined by a specified radius and angle.
Argument 1: The relative angle of the arc that the robot will take (in radians). Should be positive.
Argument 2: The radius (in meters) of the arc the robot must drive along. If positive, the robot will move right in a clockwise arc. If negative, the robot will move left in a counterclockwise arc.
Argument 3: Determines whether the robot drives forwards or backwards from its current position. Must be 1 or -1 (1 for forwards, and -1 for backwards).
Argument 4: The speed (in meters per second) at which the robot moves. Must be any real number, in the range of 1 to 10.

navigate_to_position(float32 xp, float32 yp, float32 zp, float32 xo, float32 yo, float32 zo, float32 wo): The robot will go to the position that we specify based on the robot’s internal coordinate system
Argument 1: The x-position of the desired final location, according to the robot’s coordinate system.
Argument 2: The y-position of the desired final location, according to the robot’s coordinate system
Argument 3: The z-position of the desired final location, according to the robot’s coordinate system, usually will be 0 when the robot is on the ground. Set to 0 always.
Argument 4: The final x-orientation of the robot. Set to 0 always.
Argument 5: The final y-orientation of the robot. Set to 0 always.
Argument 6: The final z-orientation of the robot. Set to 0 always.
Argument 7: The final w-orientation of the robot. Set to 0 always.

The "createrobot" class has a function called "move_robot" that calls the above functions to make the robot move. The "move_robot" function takes in the desired motion parameters and calls the appropriate functions to make the robot move. Here's an example of how to call the "move_robot" function to make the robot move 2 meters forward at medium speed:

```
from robot import createrobot

robot = createrobot()

robot.move_robot(2, 5)
```

In this example, we first import the "createrobot" class from the "robot.py" file. We then create an instance of the "createrobot" class and call the "move_robot" function with the desired motion parameters. In this case, we want to move 2 meters forward at medium speed, so we pass in 2 as the distance parameter and 5 as the max_translation_speed parameter.

The "createrobot" class has a method called "move_robot" that calls the above functions to make the robot move in different ways. Here is an example of how to use the "move_robot" method to make the robot move 2 meters forward at medium speed:

```python
from robot import createrobot

robot = createrobot()

robot.move_robot(2, 5)
```

In this example, we create an instance of the "createrobot" class and call its "move_robot" method with the arguments "2" and "5". The first argument is the distance (in meters) the robot should travel, and the second argument is the speed (in meters\"\") at which the robot will move. In this case, the robot will move 2 meters forward at medium speed (5 meters per second).

Given the functions below, write Python code to make a robot drive in a wide circle.

Below is a list of functions that control a robot from a class called "createrobot" in "robot.py":

Argument 4: The speed (in meters per second) at which the robot moves. Must be any real number, in the range of 1 to 10.

Argument 1: The x-position of the desired final location, according to the robot’s coordinate system.

Output:

To make a robot drive in a wide circle, we can use the following sequence of commands:

```python
import robot

robot = robot.create_robot()

# Set the initial position of the robot
robot.set_position(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1)

# Drive in a wide circle
robot.drive_arc(2*3.14159, 1, 1, 1)

# Stop the robot
robot.stop()
```

In this code, we first import the "create_robot" function from the "robot" module. We then create an instance of the robot by calling this function.

We then set the initial position of the robot to be at the origin (0, 0, 0) with orientation (0, 0, 0, 1).

We then call the "drive_arc" function to make the robot drive in a wide circle. The first argument is the angle of the arc, which is 2*pi (360 degrees) in this case. The second argument is the radius of the arc, which is 1 meter in this case. The third argument is the direction of translation, which is 1 (forwards) in this case. The fourth argument is the maximum translation speed, which is 1 meter per second in this case.

Finally, we call the "stop" function to stop the robot.

Output:
Using only the functions below, write Python code to make a robot drive 2 meters forward.

Below are all the functions that control a robot from a class called "createrobot" in "robot.py":

drive_distance(float32 distance, float32 max_translation_speed): The robot will drive straight until it has traveled the specified distance in the odometry frame and then stop. It will drive backwards if distance is negative.
Argument 1: The distance (in meters) the robot should travel, positive for forwards and negative for backwards motion
Argument 2: The speed (in meters per second) at which the robot will move (any real number in the range of 1 to 10).

rotate_angle(float32 angle, float32 max_rotation_speed): The robot will rotate until it has achieved the desired angle offset.
Argument 1: The relative angle of rotation (in radians) from the current position. If the angle is negative, the robot will rotate clockwise. If the angle is positive, the robot will rotate counterclockwise.
Argument 2: The speed (in radians per second) at which the robot will rotate (any real number in the range of 1 to 10).

drive_arc(float32 angle, float32 radius, int8 translate_direction, float32 max_translation_speed): The robot will drive along an arc defined by a specified radius and angle.
Argument 1: The relative angle of the arc that the robot will take (in radians). Should be positive.
Argument 2: The radius (in meters) of the arc the robot must drive along. If positive, the robot will move right in a clockwise arc. If negative, the robot will move left in a counterclockwise arc.
Argument 3: Determines whether the robot drives forwards or backwards from its current position. Must be 1 or -1 (1 for forwards, and -1 for backwards).
Argument 4: The speed (in meters per second) at which the robot moves. Must be any real number, in the range of 1 to 10.

navigate_to_position(float32 xp, float32 yp, float32 zp, float32 xo, float32 yo, float32 zo, float32 wo): The robot will go to the position that we specify based on the robot’s internal coordinate system
Argument 1: The x-position of the desired final location, according to the robot’s coordinate system.
Argument 2: The y-position of the desired final location, according to the robot’s coordinate system
Argument 3: The z-position of the desired final location, according to the robot’s coordinate system, usually will be 0 when the robot is on the ground. Set to 0 always.
Argument 4: The final x-orientation of the robot. Set to 0 always.
Argument 5: The final y-orientation of the robot. Set to 0 always.
Argument 6: The final z-orientation of the robot. Set to 0 always.
Argument 7: The final w-orientation of the robot. Set to 0 always.

To make the robot drive 2 meters forward, we can use the "drive_distance" function as follows:

```python
from robot import createrobot

robot = createrobot()

robot.drive_distance(2, 1)
```

This will make the robot drive 2 meters forward at a speed of 1 meter per second.

The following code can be used to make the robot drive 2 meters forward:

```python
from LLM_based_robot_revised import RobotFunctions

robot = RobotFunctions()

robot.drive_distance(2, 1)
```

This code will create an instance of the "RobotFunctions" class and call the "drive_distance" function with a distance of 2 meters and a maximum translation speed of 1 meter per second. The robot will then start driving forward until it has traveled 2 meters.
